# What is a data structure?
# Data structures is a collection of values, algorithms are the steps or processes we put in place to manipulate these collection of values .

# Data Structures + Alogirthms = Programs
# A person who knows how to write data structures and algorithms can write programs,good programs.

# Based on different scenarios data needs to be stored in specific formats. We have a handful of data structures that cover are needs.

# How computers store memory
# In order for a computer to run code it needs to keep track variables such as numbers, strings ,array .
# These varibales are stored in what we call Random Access Memory(RAM) that how programs run.
# We have storage(disk drive,flash drive etc.) where the computer stores videos , images ,audio files etc .
# Data on storage is persistent i.e permanant , when you turn off your computer the data will still be present in the computer
# Whereas in RAM you loose the memory when the computer is turned off.
# So you might be wondering why dont we always store data in storage ?
# The thing is persistent storage is slow.
# A computer is run by its CPU, we can think of it as a little worker that does all the work inside our computer.
# And this CPU needs to get access to the RAM and the storage , but it can get access to this RAM much faster.

# Different Operations that can be performed
# Insertion : Add a new data item to a collection of items.
# Deletion : Removing data from list
# Traversal : Access each data item once so it can be accessed.
# Searching : Finding the location of a data item if it exists in a collection.
# Sorting : Having data that is sorted.
# Access : How do we access data in computer.
